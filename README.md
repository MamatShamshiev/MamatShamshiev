## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Here's a few of my projects you can take a look at:

| Project | Description |
| ------- | --------------|
| [Top 3% solution for Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/Kaggle-APTOS-2019-Blindness-Detection) | Trained a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to speed up disease detection. |
| [Neural Differential Equations](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/Neural_Differential_Equations) | My review (in Russian) and experiments on a paper [Â«Neural Ordinary Differential EquationsÂ»](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf), which received the Best Paper award at NeurIPS 2018. |
| [Comparative study of intrinsic motivations (Exploration in RL)](https://github.com/vlad-filin/spinningup_curiousity) | The final project of [Advanced Topics in Reinforcement Learning](http://deeppavlov.ai/rl_course_2020#!/tab/168247558-2) course by YSDA & DeepPavlov. Implemented and conducted experiments with Random Network Distillation, Forward/Backward dynamics models and Itrinsic curiosity module.|
