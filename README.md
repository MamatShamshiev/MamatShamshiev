## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Here's a few of my projects you can take a look at:

| Project | Description |
| ------- | --------------|
| [Avatar-Product Interaction Image Generation](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/avatar_product_interaction) | A research-grade pipeline for generating high-fidelity avatar-product interaction images using state-of-the-art diffusion models. |
| [2nd Place Solution of AI Journey Contest: AITrain track](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/ai-train) | Developed a computer vision system for Semantic Rail Scene Understanding based on [Panoptic FPN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02446.pdf) and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). |
| [Top 3% solution for Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/Kaggle-APTOS-2019-Blindness-Detection) | Trained a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to speed up disease detection. |
| [Neural Differential Equations](https://github.com/MamatShamshiev/Neural_Differential_Equations) | My review (in Russian), tutorial and experiments on a paper [Â«Neural Ordinary Differential EquationsÂ»](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf), which received the Best Paper award at NeurIPS 2018. |
